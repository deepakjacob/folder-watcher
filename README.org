* Folder Watcher
** Introduction
   This Rust project is a simple yet effective folder watcher. It utilizes the notify crate to monitor changes within a specified directory, reporting any file creations, modifications, or deletions in real-time.

** Installation
   Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   #+begin_src sh
   git clone https://your-repository-url-here
   cd folder-watcher
   #+end_src

** Usage
   To run the folder watcher, navigate to the project directory and execute:
   #+begin_src sh
   cargo run
   #+end_src
   This will start monitoring the current directory (and subdirectories) for any file system changes.

** Code Explanation
*** Dependencies
    - The 'notify' crate is used for watching file system changes.
*** Main Function
    - A channel is set up for inter-thread communication.
    - A watcher is created using notify's recommended_watcher, configured to watch changes recursively.
    - The program enters a loop where it waits for events from the watcher and prints them to the console.

** Handling Events
    Events are received through a channel. Each event type is printed to the console, providing real-time updates on the file system's state.

** Common Issues
*** Runtime Errors
    - Permissions: Make sure the executable has sufficient permissions to watch the directory.
    - Path Errors: Verify that the path specified is correct and accessible.
